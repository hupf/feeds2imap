1. Configuration
-----------------

Copy the sample configuration file and add your IMAP configuration and feeds:
    cp config.xml.sample MyFeeds.xml

To import your feeds from Thunderbird's "News & Blogs", export them as OPML
file and use the following command (or any other XSLT processor) to generate a
feeds2imap config file:
    xsltproc opml2config.xslt MyFeeds.opml > MyFeeds.xml


2. Installation
---------------

Test your feeds by running:
    ./feeds2imap.py -v MyFeeds.xml

Create a cronjob entry, e.g.:
    30 * * * *      /path/to/feeds2imap.py /path/to/MyFeeds.xml


3. Usage
--------

Use your favourite email application to read the feeds. In Thunderbird click on "Click here to always load remote images from feeds2imap.".

The IMAP folders will always be created automatically if you add new feeds. To delete a feed, simply remove its entry in the configuration file and delete the IMAP folder.
